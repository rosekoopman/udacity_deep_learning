    "I first tried with LR=0.01 as suggested in as the best first choice in the hyperparameter section of this course. The loss decreased a bit but soon started oscillating around one value, so I decided to decrease the learning rate to LR=0.001. For embedding size I chose 300, the hidden dim 256 and number of hidden layers 2. Again, acoording to the hyperparameter section of this course pretty standard choices for a first guess. For batch size I chose 128 to have sufficiently large badges to get some computational advatage, but still have to possibility to introduce some noise between batches. I started out with a sequence length of 32, but decreased this to 16 (and even experimented with 8). I didn't see a big change when changing the sequence length. I suppose a length of 32 is a bit too long, because this is typically longer than a sentence, although it might help to get a more coherent text. A sequence length of 8 seemed to perform a little worse than 16 but differences were marginal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I didn't manage to get the loss below 3.5, I experimented with changing the number of layers in the LSTM and changing the number of dimensions of the embedding. All the changes I made only had marginal effects and the loss wouldn't drop below 3.7 (although for some setups the loss was still decreasing after 15 epochs, albeit super slowly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I did some research online and I found that the network architecture I used what slightly different from some proposed solutions: I had a dropout layer between the lstm and the fully connected layer, whereas other solutions had not. So I removed this dropout layer and trained again with the best settings I had found so far, and suddenly my loss dropped very fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the commented cell below for the experiments I ran.\n",
    "\n",
    "**question: why was it wrong to have a dropout layer between the lstm and the fully connected layer? I am a bit surprised as this dropout layer was used in the examples shown in the course. How can it have such a desastrous effect?**"
