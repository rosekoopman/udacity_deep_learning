# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

This repository contains my work for the [Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101) offered by Udacity. Four projects are included:

- project 1: Build a fully connected neural network from scratch to predict bike sharing patterns.

- project 2: Create a new Seinfeld TV script using RNNs.

- project 3: Generate new images of faces using generative adversarial networks.

- project 4: Build a sentiment detection model for movies using RNNs and deploy the model using AWS services to make the model available to end users.
